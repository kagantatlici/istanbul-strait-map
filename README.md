Setup done for local development and MCP stubs.

Usage:

- Run tests: `npx playwright test`

MCPs:
- `playwright`: configured with `playwright.config.ts` and an example test
- `git`: repo initialized with `.gitignore`
- `Context 7` and `memory`: stubs in `mcp-config.json` â€” provide package names to install

// NEXT: Document Context 7 and Memory integration steps per PRD Section 3.2
