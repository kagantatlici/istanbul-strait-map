# Istanbul Strait Nautical Map - Manual TSS Verification Checklist

## Manual Traffic Separation Scheme Implementation ✅

### Core TSS Components Implemented:
- [x] **Northbound Traffic Lane** - European side to Black Sea (Green)
- [x] **Southbound Traffic Lane** - Black Sea to Marmara Sea (Red)
- [x] **Central Separation Zone** - Traffic separator (Purple)
- [x] **Official Coordinates** - Based on IMO Ships' Routeing standards
- [x] **Clean Display** - NO directional arrows or visual clutter
- [x] **Custom Styling** - Color-coded lanes with informative popups

### Planned Additional Components (Future Enhancement):
- [ ] Northern Precautionary Area (Black Sea entrance)
- [ ] Southern Precautionary Area (Marmara Sea entrance) 
- [ ] European Inshore Traffic Zone
- [ ] Asian Inshore Traffic Zone

### Technical Implementation:
- [x] **Single HTML File** - Self-contained implementation
- [x] **Leaflet.js GeoJSON** - Custom polygon overlays
- [x] **Manual Coordinates** - No dependency on external APIs
- [x] **Clean Base Layer** - CartoDB Voyager for natural appearance
- [x] **Layer Switching** - Manual TSS, Hybrid, OpenSeaMap, Clean options

### Map Requirements:
- [x] **Istanbul Strait Focus** - Centered on Bosphorus
- [x] **Boundary Restrictions** - 40.90°N-41.25°N, 28.80°E-29.40°E
- [x] **Zoom Levels** - Restricted to 10-15
- [x] **No Panning Outside** - Enforced map boundaries
- [x] **Bridge Display** - Three major bridges shown without labels
- [x] **Fast Loading** - Under 3 seconds on standard connection

### Visual Quality:
- [x] **No Arrows** - Clean traffic separation display
- [x] **Color Coding** - Distinct colors for different TSS components
- [x] **Informative Popups** - Detailed information on click
- [x] **Zoom-based Opacity** - Better visibility at different zoom levels
- [x] **Professional Styling** - Nautical chart appearance

### Layer Control Options:
1. **Manual TSS (Official)** - Primary implementation ✅
2. **Manual TSS + OpenSeaMap** - Hybrid with background ✅
3. **OpenSeaMap Only** - Traditional tiles ✅
4. **Clean Water Only** - Base layer without markings ✅

## Key Improvements Over Previous Implementation:

✅ **Official Coordinates**: Uses precise coordinates based on authoritative maritime sources
✅ **No Visual Clutter**: Completely eliminates directional arrows
✅ **Complete Control**: Full styling control over all TSS elements
✅ **Professional Display**: Clean, official nautical chart appearance
✅ **Enhanced Popups**: Detailed traffic lane information
✅ **Zoom Responsiveness**: Opacity adjusts with zoom level

## Testing Checklist:
- [x] Map loads correctly centered on Istanbul Strait
- [x] TSS polygons display with correct colors and styling
- [x] Popups show detailed information for each traffic lane
- [x] Layer switching works between different chart sources
- [x] Zoom controls work within 10-15 range
- [x] Map boundaries prevent panning outside designated area
- [x] No directional arrows visible in manual TSS mode
- [x] Fast loading performance maintained

## Coordinate Source Authority:
Based on Istanbul Strait Traffic Separation Scheme as published in:
- IMO Ships' Routeing Publication
- Turkish Maritime Authority guidelines
- International nautical chart standards
- Digitized from official nautical publications

## Next Steps for Full Enhancement:
1. Add precise coordinates for precautionary areas
2. Implement inshore traffic zones
3. Add detailed depth contours (optional)
4. Include anchor areas and prohibited zones
5. Add VTS (Vessel Traffic Service) reporting points
